# company-valuation-cashflow
Uses FMPcloud API to fetch financial data from the limited amount of companies available. Program that allows us to input company from a list on FMPcloud and evaluate a company's liquidity from Income statement, Balance sheet, Cash flow statement, among other metrics.

FMPcloud will not be used for the entire project, only initially, as I will develop my own API using BS4 and Flask.
